## SMS Spam Detector

This project is a SMS spam detector using machine learning. It utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between spam and non-spam text messages. The model is trained on a dataset, and the README provides details on how to use and deploy the spam detector. Key features include:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Model:** It employs a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The project assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Usage:** The README provides information on how to use the SMS spam detector, load your own dataset, and apply the model to classify SMS messages as spam or not.
- **Requirements:** It lists the required libraries and dependencies for running the project.
- **License:** The project may include information about the licensing of the code and data used.
